 * The SDL virtual key representation.

 * the unmodified character that would be generated by pressing the key, or an
 * `SDLK_*` constant for those keys that do not generate characters.
 *
 * A special exception is the number keys at the top of the keyboard which map
 * to SDLK_0...SDLK_9 on AZERTY layouts.
