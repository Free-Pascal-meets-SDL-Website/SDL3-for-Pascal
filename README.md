## Bugs / Contributions / ToDos

If you have any contributions or bugfixes, feel free to drop a pull request or send in a patch.
Please use the GitHub [issue tracker](https://github.com/PascalGameDevelopment/SDL3-for-Pascal/issues).

### ToDos

- create working units (main focus)
- adapt comments to [PasDoc format](https://pasdoc.github.io) (later)

### Code style guidelines

The main principle is to stay as tight as possible at the names in the C headers.
These guidelines aim to have better consistency in this community project and make
it easier to find certain code parts in the C headers/Pascal includes. Feel free
to discuss or extend these guidelines, use the issue tracker.

For details please refer to our [Translation Code Style Sheet](STYLESHEET.md).
